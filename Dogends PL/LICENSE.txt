If you see this Dogends.jar file, 
you have to know, that the entire code is written by Woulfiee (michaln444@gmail.com) 
and you mustn't change anything in this code.

I allow you to:
 - look at the things I did,
 - copy MAX 2 lines of the code from there.

I don't allow you to:
 - sharing it and saying, that this plugin was made by you (you mustn't steal),
 - sharing it to others without my knowledge,
 - selling this plugin.
 
Thanks for reading! I hope you won't steal my plugin ;)
 
Regards,
Woulfiee and Dogends staff
